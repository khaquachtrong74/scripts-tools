Save tasks of my school (subject: Open Source) 
I already save Questions, tasks, Documents and my homeworks
# BashShell
You can use play_audio to run some song (mp3-audio) in folder Audio that I downloads with yt-dlp with terminal.
Enjoy it.
# Update:09/02/2025
Fix and update play-audio with dialog to make it cool
Should have python 3.x >= 3.8
Ok, Right now you can use play-audio.bash to run song or download-youtube-audio.bash to get some .mp3 awsome you find on youtube.
but with download-youtube-audio.bash maybe package yt-dlp having some error *I can't find any solution suitable with me!*

> I note some packages that you need to run scripts.
